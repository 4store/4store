To install Raptor (RDF parser) and Rasqal (SPARQL parser)
---------------------------------------------------------

# install a 64-bit raptor from freshly extracted source

./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib64 && make
sudo make install

# similarly for 64-bit rasqal

./configure "--enable-query-languages=laqrs sparql rdql" \
 --libdir=/usr/local/lib64 && make
sudo make install


# ensure PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set correctly
# ensure /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ includes /usr/local/lib64

sudo ldconfig



Other installation hints
------------------------

Make sure /var/lib/4store/ exists (in a cluster it need only exist
on backend nodes) and that the user or users who will create new KBs
have permission to write to this directory.


For clusters (or to test cluster tools on a single machine)
the frontend must have a file /etc/4s-cluster which lists all
machines in the cluster.


To avoid problems running out of Avahi DBUS connections:

modify /etc/dbus-1/system.d/avahi-dbus.conf
    Increase max_connections_per_user to 200 or so
    Optionally increase max_match_rules_per_connection to 512 or so


To install just the frontend tools on non-cluster frontends
-----------------------------------------------------------

# pre-requisites for installing the frontend tools

yum install pcre-devel avahi avahi-tools avahi-devel

in src/common:
	make

in src/frontend:
	make
	make install
