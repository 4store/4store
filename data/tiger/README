TIGER schema was from http://labs.intellidimension.com/tiger/

TIGER data derived from US Census 2006 TIGER data (now obsolete)
using the included tiger.pl script. If you have a source of 2006 vintage
TIGER data you can use it to generate more test data in the same schema.

We use this in 4store as a source of non-synthetic test data (real world data
is good for throwing up unexpected scenarios that might not be tested by
synthetic data)

I've begun to deviate from the intellidimension.com usage, in particular
they claim that a named feature has a feature code, whereas I observe
that in line features, such as roads, each line segment has a feature code
(e.g. Harrison St may at times run through a tunnel)

Current versions of the tiger.pl script also deviate by using a per-edition
identifier for URIs of some items like polygons which are not uniquely
numbered across editions.
