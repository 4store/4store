.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility enables a 4store cluster (or single host) to be managed through a
number of supported commands.
Commands available are
.Sy list-nodes , Sy list-stores , Sy start-stores , Sy stop-stores ,
.Sy delete-stores .
Details on individual commands are below:
.Ss Command: list-nodes
Prints a list of all nodes in their cluster, and their status.
Output contains:
  node_number - starting at 0, the numbered index of a node in a cluster
  hostname    - name of the cluster node
  port        - the port that 4s-boss is running on
  status      - whether 4s-boss on that node is reachable or not
  ip_address  - IPv4 or IPv6 address of the node
.Ss Command: list-stores
Prints a list of all stores found on the cluster, along with their status.
The output will contain:
  store_name     - name of the store
  store_status   - whether the store is usable or not
  backend_status - status of the 4s-backend processes the store uses
.Pp
options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl \-verbose
Will show status of each backend on each node separately, rather than by
store.
.El
.Pp
The store_status will either be 'available' or 'unavailable'.
If a store is available, then it means that all necessary backend processes
are running on the cluster, and the store can be used with 4s-httpd, 4s-query,
and 4s-import.
If a store is not available, the 'backend_status' will list the reason why.
.Pp
If a backend is listed as 'stopped', it means that the 4s-backend process for
a store is definitely stopped on one or more nodes of a cluster.
If it is listed as 'unknown', this means that 4s-admin was unable to determine
the state of the backend process.
.Ss Command: start-stores, stop-stores
Starts or stops one or more stores on the cluster.
.Pp
options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a, \-all
Starts or stops all stores on the cluster.
.El
.Pp
If the -a or --all option isn't present, then a space separated list of store
names to start or stop should be given.
.Pp
Each node is asked in turn to start or stop the 4s-backend process stores
given.
.Pp
For each node, this command will print:
  node_number - starting at 0, the numbered index of a node in a cluster
  hostname    - name of the cluster node
.Pp
For each 4s-backend process on the node, it will print:
  store_name     - name of the store
  backend_status - whether 4s-backend is now stopped or running
.Pp
The backend_status will be one of 'stopped', 'running', or 'unknown'.
.Pp
If start-stores is called for an already running store, or a stop-stores for
an already stopped store, then each node will take no action, but the status
of the backend will be printed.
.Ss Command: delete-stores
Deletes one or more stores from a cluster.
.Pp
Accepts a space separated list of stores to delete as arguments.
.Pp
Establishes a connection to all nodes of the cluster, stops a store if it is
running, then deletes that store.
.Ss Configuration file options
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy nodes = <node_list>
Semicolon separated list of hosts in the cluster. 
.El
.Pp
Options for
.Mn
in
.Pa /etc/4store.conf
should all be within the
[4s-boss] section, or will be ignored.
.Pp
See
.Xr 4store.conf 5
for details on how to specify a cluster.
.Ss General Usage
When any
.Nm
command is called, it first reads
.Pa /etc/4store.conf
to determine the hostnames of nodes in the cluster.
It will then attempt to communicate with the
.Xr 4s-boss 8
daemon running on that node (running on port 6733 by default).
.Pp
Running the list-nodes command is the simplest way of checking that all nodes
are reachable over the network, and the 4s-boss on each is responding.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /etc/4store.conf
Main 4store configuration file, used to determine which hosts are in
the cluster.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Stop all stores on the cluster:
.Pp
.Dl $ 4s-admin stop-stores --all
.Pp
Start the stores
.Qq foo
and
.Qq bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ 4s-admin start-stores foo bar
.Pp
Delete stores
.Qq kb1 ,
.Qq kb2 ,
and
.Qq kb3 :
.Pp
.Dl $ 4s-admin delete-stores kb1 kb2 kb3

.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.Nm
should not be run as root, use a non-privileged account instead.
.Pp
Since it can request that any nodes of a cluster start/stop/delete stores, 
only trusted users should be able to run
.Nm ,
or send packets to 4s-boss on cluster nodes.
